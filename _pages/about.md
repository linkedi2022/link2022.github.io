1st Language and Interaction Network Event 
======
The 1st Language and Interaction Network event (LINk) will take place in Edinburgh on the **8th and 9th of October, 2022**. It is organized by the Psycholinguistics Coffee, a journal club run at the University of Edinburgh.

Our aim for this event is to create a space for ECR and PGT currently working or interested in Psycholinguistics in the UK to get to know each other, create networks and a community. We want to bring people together to discuss research, be it what we are currently working on, what interests us, and what we believe could be improved, as well as to share our experiences.

The event will consist of a series of workshops, talks, poster sessions and round tables. Workshops and talks will be hybrid, with remote participants being able to submit questions in parallel to in-person attendees; poster sessions will be in person but the posters will be uploaded online. You can find our program [here](https://linkedi2022.github.io/program/).

This event is a **free **: there are no registration fees, and we will provide free poster printing for presenters and lunch and snacks for in-person attendees.

In this website, you can find information about call for poster and workshop abstracts, registration for the conference, the programme, and the venue.

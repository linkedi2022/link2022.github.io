LINk is a free event, meaning that there are no fees! However, we ask you to register your attendance so we can provide enough catering and do so considering attendees' dietary requirements.

**You can now register following [this link](https://edinburgh.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eERqASwMp3ZExWC)**.

We will ask you to register **even if you are also presenting**, so we can keep track of the numbers.

### In-person attendees

Given the feedback we gathered, we can host 40 people including presenters in-person. Therefore, we will work on a first-come-first-served basis while giving priority to those who will present in the conference.

If you cannot get a ticket, we will include you in the waiting list. As attendees may be travelling to Edinburgh, we will send a reminder for those who signed up to confirm their attendance 15 days prior to the conference. 

We understand that due to the requirement to book in case of travelling, the earlier we let potential attendees know the better. Therefore, we will contact at least 15 days in advance those in the waiting list in case there is a free spot.  

### Online attendees

For those attending on-line, we will ask you to register too. We will contact you with the details on how to join the talks and workshops, as well as to access the posters presented.

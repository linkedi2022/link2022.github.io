We are accepting abstracts for both posters and workshops, please find the guidelines for each submission below.
We are also looking for reviewers: If you wish to review abstracts, please show your interest in the submission box, by email to ppls.psycholingcoffee[at]ed.ac.uk or by completing this reviewer submission.

Call for poster abstracts
=====
We invite submissions in any area of psycholinguistics, with a focus on work by PGT/ECR. Both completed works and on-going research as welcome. We aim to print the posters for presenters, so note that if your abstract gets accepted, we will ask you for your poster a week before the conference. 

Abstracts are due on September 1st, and may be submitted via our submission portal [here](https://edinburgh.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3wJriza6k3bDDmu).

Submission guidelines
-----
+ Abstracts should be submitted as a PDF file.
+ No identifying information.
+ Abstracts should be formatted in 12pt Arial font.
+ Title and up to four keywords.

Authors are permitted one full A4 page of text and an additional page for supplementary materials (e.g., examples of stimuli, figures, references).

Call for workshop abstracts
=====
If you feel confident in a particular skill and like to teach, we invite submissions for workshops in areas related to experimental research, with a focus on skills relevant to PGT/ECR researchers.

In a previous survey, people reported interest in workshops on writing reports in RMarkdown and LaTex, science communication, public engagement, Bayesian statistics, or computational psycholinguistics.

Note that you can submit an abstract for a workshop for skills other than the ones listed here – this is just a set of examples.

In your submission, we will ask you if you would like to run a workshop by yourself or with someone else.

This is in case different people submit similar abstracts – again, the goal of this conference is to create a sense of community among PGT/ECR working in psycholinguistics.

Workshops will be in-person but we wish to also stream them online. Workshops will last 1.5 hours.
Abstracts are due on the 1st September, and may be submitted via our submission portal [here](https://edinburgh.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eyS0eGXWR5cEv6m).

Review of submissions will occur in **two stages**:
In the _first round_, we will ask you for:
+ The title of your workshop.
+ General topic of your workshop
+ Up to 4 key words.
+ A description (in PDF format) of what you want to cover (up to 400 words). Note this means we do not expect you to explain how you will do everything
+ Whether you mind working with someone else.

In the _second round_, circa 12 days after your submission, we will contact you if your submission is accepted for the following information:
+ A rough timeline of your workshop (e.g., activities planned).
+ Whether participants will be required to prepare materials in advance.
+ Any logistic resources you will need to run the workshop
+ At this stage, we will also contact you in case a similar proposal was submitted and you wish to create the workshop with someone else.

Submission guidelines
-----
+ Abstracts should be submitted as a PDF file, with a maximum of 400 words (see our two-stages procedure above).
+ No identifying information.
+ Abstracts should be formatted in 12pt Arial font.

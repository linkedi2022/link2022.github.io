:-----:|--------
**9:00am** <br><br> <br><br> <br>| **Roundtable** <br> In this session, we wish to discuss different topics regarding how we conduct science: e.g, future directions in Psycholinguistics, interdisciplinarity, and how we can improve the science we do (including how to improve our working spaces and reproducibility). To promove conversations amongst ourselves, this roundtable will be done in small teams and then we will put together what we have discussed. <br> We will count with the help of different moderators to hear their insights on these topics.
**10:30am** | **Coffee Break**
**11:00am** <br> <br> <br>| **Workshop: Computational Modelling in Psycholinguistics** <br> <br> Irene Winther (PhD at the University of Edinburgh) will take over the second workshop. Irene will provide a general introduction to using computational language models for psycholinguistic research, showing what they involve and how it’s done.
**12:30pm** <br> <br>| **Lunch Break** <br> Catering will be provided by the venue.
**14:00pm** <br> <br>| **Poster Session Online** <br> Second poster session of the conference.
**16:00pm** <br> <br> <br> <br>|  **Closing event** <br> To conclude the event, we will discuss what we have been talking during the event and exchange ideas. Likewise, we will like to discuss the possibility of continuing this event (hosted by PPLS or any other university/department) and how this event can be improved.

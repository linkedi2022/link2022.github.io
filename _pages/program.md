**9:00am** <br><br> <br><br> <br>| **Roundtable** <br> In this session, we wish to discuss different topics regarding how we conduct science: e.g, future directions in Psycholinguistics, interdisciplinarity, and how we can improve the science we do (including how to improve our working spaces and reproducibility). To promove conversations amongst ourselves, this roundtable will be done in small teams and then we will put together what we have discussed. <br> We will count with the help of different moderators to hear their insights on these topics.

Likewise, we will like to discuss the possibility of continuing this event (hosted by PPLS or any other university/department) and how this event can be improved.
